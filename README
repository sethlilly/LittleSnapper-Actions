This is the source for my free Google Chrome extension, LittleSnapper Actions.

If you're like me, you're constantly dragging items to your Bookmarks bar to read later or to keep for inspiration. You're also snapping pages and images to Realmac Software's LittleSnapper. Since LittleSnapper doesn't yet support snapping from Chrome, we're left with the bookmarklet method, which is handy - unless your bookmarks move around a lot like mine do.

Enter the LittleSnapper Actions extension. It keeps modified versions of the bookmarklets in the Extensions area to make them easily accessible. Open Page in LittleSnapper opens the page in the LittleSnapper browser, while Snap Page to LittleSnapper snaps the page you're currently viewing in Chrome, bypassing the LittleSnapper browser.

It's available for download at https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/poncfffeklffecndajbhmfemilkjamhl.
